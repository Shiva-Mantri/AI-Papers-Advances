## Reinforcement Learning
* [Replacing Rewards with Examples: Example-Based Policy Search via Recursive Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12656). From [Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/03/recursive-classification-replacing.html) - Most reinforcement learning algorithms for teaching agents to perform new tasks require a reward function, which provides positive feedback to the agent for taking actions that lead to good outcomes. Alternatively, training a model using examples, called example-based control, has the potential to overcome the limitations of approaches that rely on traditional reward functions.
